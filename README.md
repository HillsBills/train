this is an uncleaned python project.
it uses csv module, different files, and builds an attendance program.
the main functionality is managing employees, updating time attendances and creating different attendance reports

I first used classes but then thought it isnt actually used
It is basically finished, just not clean.
There is more functinality I wanted to add plus better coding, but that probably wont happen.

should i add md?
